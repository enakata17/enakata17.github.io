      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <p>
        1: This is the datasheet for the n-mosfet transistor: https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/DMT6009LCT.pdfLinks to an external site. 
        What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?

        <br>

        2: Draw a schematic for a circuit with using at least your arduino, a DC motor, a flyback diode, and capacitors between power and ground. 
        Find parts with datasheets you could use for each of these schematic components.

        3: Here is the datasheet for the L293D chip: https://www.ti.com/product/L293DLinks to an external site. 
        Draw a schematic using at least your arduino, this chip, and two motors. 
        Write (pseudo) code that shows how you would move the motors both forward, both back, 
        then one forward one back, and one back then forward.
