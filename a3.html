            Analog Input

            Demonstrates analog input by reading an analog sensor on analog pin 0 and
            turning on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 13.
            The amount of time the LED will be on and off depends on the value obtained
            by analogRead().

            The circuit:
            - potentiometer
                center pin of the potentiometer to the analog input 0
                one side pin (either one) to ground
                the other side pin to +5V
            - LED
                anode (long leg) attached to digital output 13 through 220 ohm resistor
                cathode (short leg) attached to ground

            - Note: because most Arduinos have a built-in LED attached to pin 13 on the
                board, the LED is optional.

        3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. 
        Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. 
        How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.
