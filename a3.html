      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <p>
        1: In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? 
        Justify your answer with example calculations.

        3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. 
        Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. 
        How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.
