      I used 220 ohm resistors, which is the closest standard resistor with a value over 160 ohms.

        /*
          Blink

          Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

          Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
          it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
          the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
          If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
          model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

        int green = 10; // variable and pin number for green LED
        int red = 12; // variable and pin number for red LED

        // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <p>
        1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. 
        Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Voltage (V) vs Time (s)

        2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? 
        How much current would that draw?
        <br>
        According to the data sheet for Arduino Uno, each I/O pin can safely provide a maximum of 20mA; 
        however, the total combined current for all 14 I/O pins should not exceed 200mA. 
        This means that you could blink 10 LEDs across 10 pins with your Arduino, 
        drawing that maximum 200mA, but not exceeding it.
        <br>
        <br>
        4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
        <br>
        After testing the LEDs blink speed with my Arduino, 
        I found that you can no longer tell that they are blinking when set to 0.012 seconds, or 12 milliseconds.

        5: Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? 
        If yes, please provide details on how/when, as well as a brief reflection. 
        If no, you can either leave this question blank, or provide other information if you'd like.

        I used ChatGPT to figure out how to put in a code block and debug my code in order to put the video of my circuit and LEDs blinking into html. 
        I’ve never put a code snippet or a video into an html before, and although VS Code gives automatic suggestions, 
        it wasn’t quite working. After it instructed me to use a code block and ensure my file type was correct for the video, 
        I used w3schools to help structure and finish my code. 
        It was definitely helpful to find the bug, which was mp4 versus quicktime, 
        because I am not the most well versed coder or tech savvy person, 
        and didn’t even know there were different types of videos. 
        As for the code block, I was able to eliminate a lot of "br" tags in my code.
        The AI tools really just pointed me in the right direction before I continued researching on my own.
