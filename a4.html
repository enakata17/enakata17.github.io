      Image of my calculations for the resistances needed for my circuit.
      I used a 220 ohm resistor for the red LED, a 100 ohm resistor for the blue LED, and a 10k ohm resistor for the photoresistor.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <p>
        1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
        <pre><code>
        void loop() {
            for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) {
            myservo.write(pos); 
            delay(100); 
            }
        } 
        </code>
        </pre>
        Draw a graph with the x-axis as time and the y-axis as voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.

        <br>

        2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. 
        How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.
        <br>
        <br>
        Answer.
        <br>
        <br>

        3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate 
        from the true measurement up or down by 10%. 
        How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.
        <br>

        4: Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? 
        If yes, please provide details on how/when, as well as a brief reflection. 
        If no, you can either leave this question blank, or provide other information if you'd like.
