      <h2>Resistance Calculation</h2>
      <img src="resistance-calculation.png" width="800" height="350"/>
      Image of my calculation for the resistance needed for my circuit, which is 160 ohms.
      I used 220 ohm resistors, which is the closest standard resistor with a value over 160 ohms.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <p>
        1: Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. 
        Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led, 255).

        2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, 
        assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, 
        how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?
        <br>
        Answer

        <br>
        3: Measure and record the actual voltage across one of your LEDs when it's on. 
        How does this compare to the theoretical forward voltage for your LED color?
