      <h2>Project Concept/Motivation</h2>
      I want to build a focus light device that acts as a visual study timer, 
      using LED feedback to help manage focus and break sessions. 
      When I press a button, the device will glow one color (e.g. blue) during focus mode, 
      and after a set amount of time, itâ€™ll switch to a different color (e.g. green) to signal a break. 
      Once the break ends, the device will automatically return to focus mode.

      <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Anticipated Bill of Materials</h2>
        - Arduino Uno (for controlling the timer and LED color changes)
        <br>
        - Breadboard + wires (for wiring my circuit)
        <br>
        - RGB LEDs (for displaying different colors for focus/breaks)
        <br>
        - Push Button (for starting and resetting the timer)
        <br>
        - Resistors (220/100/10k) (for controlling current & voltage of RGB LED and push button)
        <br>
        - Translucent/frosted jar and container (for enclosing, diffusing, and hiding the components)
      <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Timeline</h2>
        1: Research ideal focus and break durations for studying to implement in timer
        <br>
        2: Prototype LED color changes and button input on Arduino and breadboard
        <br>
        3: Test full cycle transitions
        <br>
        4: Prototype translucent/frosted jar and container: mount LED, Arduino, 
        and button inside the enclosure and test the level of diffusion
        <br>
        - Determine appropriate size of enclosure for components with cardboard prototype
        <br>
        - Find final enclosure
        <br>
        5: Final iterations, testing, and debugging to create final prototype!

      <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Contingency Plans</h2>
        - If something goes wrong with the timer code, I will simplify the operation to manually switching colors with the button.
        <br>
        - If the RGB LEDs are not working properly, I will use separate-single color LEDs for each phase.
        <br>
        - If the button input is glitching, I will debug or find a workaround in code or use a different input method.
        <br>
        - If something goes wrong with the jar and container, I will use a temporary disposable enclosure.
